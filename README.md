# Smart-Contract-Lottery
I have built a Smart Contract Lottery which will function on the EVM blockchain, the user sends a minimum participation amount in ETH and by using the Chainlink Verifiable Randomness Libraries and Interfaces we generate the winner of the lottery who gets the entire pool amount of the lottery (minus the fees for the lottery organizers)
